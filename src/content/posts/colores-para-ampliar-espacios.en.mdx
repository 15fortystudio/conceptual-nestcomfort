Colors influence how we perceive space. Using the right tones can make a small room feel larger and brighter. Here are some helpful tips:

- Warm whites and neutral tones add brightness.
- Cool colors like soft blue or mint green create a sense of spaciousness.
- Paint the ceiling a lighter shade than the walls.
- Use the same color for walls and curtains to create visual continuity.

Choosing the right palette not only enhances aestheticsâ€”it transforms the feel of a room.
