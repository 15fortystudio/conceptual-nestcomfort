For this renovation project, we reimagined a family home with over 30 years of history. The goal was to respect the original essence while introducing a contemporary and elegant style.

We used neutral tones and noble materials such as marble and natural oak, complemented by brass details and soft textiles. The interior layout was redesigned to maximize natural light and improve flow between spaces.

**Highlights:** Fusion of classic elements with modern design, curated decorative pieces with history.
