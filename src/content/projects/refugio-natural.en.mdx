The **Natural Refuge** project is a home designed with a focus on sustainability and harmony with the environment. Located in Monterrey, this residence utilizes recycled materials, energy-efficient systems, and a layout that optimizes natural light, creating a healthy and environmentally-friendly space.

Every corner of the house was designed to maximize the connection with nature, incorporating biophilic elements that help reduce stress and improve well-being.

**Highlights:** Use of solar panels, locally recycled materials, and a natural ventilation system to keep the house cool efficiently.
