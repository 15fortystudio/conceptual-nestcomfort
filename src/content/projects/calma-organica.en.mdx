The **Organic Calm** project was designed for a yoga and meditation studio focused on creating a space of absolute tranquility. We opted for a minimalist aesthetic with soft lines, diffused lighting, and materials such as bamboo, natural stone, and handcrafted textiles.

Each space was designed to provide a complete sensory experience. From the entrance to the practice room, every detail was carefully chosen to invite introspection and balance.

**Highlights:** Natural acoustic panels, ambient scents, and ergonomic furnishings.
