This project aimed to transform a downtown apartment into a warm, serene, and functional space. We used natural materials such as wood, linen, and handcrafted ceramics to create a cozy atmosphere with modern touches.

The color palette focused on earthy tones and olive greens, seeking a direct dialogue with nature through interior design. We incorporated custom furniture and decorative pieces that reflect the client's personality, achieving a balance between aesthetics and function.

**Highlights:** Warm ambient lighting, integration of natural plants, and organic textures.
